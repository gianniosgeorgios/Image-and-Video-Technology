The main purpose of the first exercise was to construct code for Image Cartoonification. The input images (.jpg)  are people's faces in the dimension of 512 x 288 pixels.First we add Noise to these Images, so as to increase variability. The noise is either:

- Gaussian 
- Salt and Pepper

Then we apply filtering to these images in order to reduce noise. The types of filtering that were studied, are: 

- Gaussian Filtering
- Mean Filtering
- Median Filtering

Now are ready to detect the edges in filtered images. The methods for Edge Detection were:

- Laplacian 
- Canny 
- Marr - Hildreth 

After all, the final result was:
